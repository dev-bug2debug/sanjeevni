It is characterized by extreme pruritis and persistent scratching which leads to papulation, exfoliation, bleeding, oozing, crusting and secondary infections. It can involve any area of the body, but typical locations of involvement vary according to age. In infants, the area around the lower part of outer ear is often involved, whereas in pre-school children, the flexor side of extremities are involved.

The less  common variants include those derived from fibrinogen (AFib), transthyretin (ATTR), lysozyme (ALys), and apolipoproteins AI or AII (AApoAI, AApoAII).Amyloid deposits composed of leukocyte chemotactic factor 2 (LECT2) are described recently and in some series are found to be the third most common amyloid subtypes after AA and AL amyloid. Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) was originally isolated and characterized from culture media of PHA-activated human T-cell leukemia cells as part of studies to identify chemotactic factors important in the pathophysiology of neoplasia. Although the original characterization of LECT2 proved to be of bovine origin from the fetal calf serum used in media, these studies led to the cloning and structural characterization of the human analog. The protein was independently characterized from fetal bovine cartilage and named chondromodulin II.The human LECT2 gene is localized to chromosome 5 (5q31.1\u2013q32) and consists of four exons and three introns.

Treponemal tests may remain reactive for life, even following adequate therapy thus a positive result suggests infection with Treponema pallidum but does not distinguish between treated and untreated infections. Therefore, the results of a nontreponemal assay, such as rapid plasma reagin, are needed to provide information on a patient's disease state and history of therapy.
